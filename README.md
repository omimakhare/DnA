## DnA Platform (Data and Analytics Platform) and its features

The idea of the DnA Platform originated from the common challenge every big company has - the need for transparency in the data and analytics area. In addition, several features were envisioned and realized, this time with the idea to enable a self-service and cloud-independent platform based holistically on open-source software. The goal is to simplify life and speed up the work of everybody who is working with data. Let's look at the [features DnA Platform offers out of the box](https://github.com/mercedes-benz/DnA/wiki).
